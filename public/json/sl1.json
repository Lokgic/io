A quantity of a categorical statement can be either universal - applying to everything in a category, particular - at least one thing in a category. Each categorical statement is also said to have either an affirmative or a negative quality.

Notice that when we draw diagrams for the two universal forms, we do not draw any x's. For these forms we are only ruling out possibilities, not asserting that things actually exist. This is part of what Venn learned from Boole. The proposition, ``All guitars are plucked instruments,'' denies the existence of any guitar that is not a plucked, but it does not assert the existence of some guitar that is a plucked. That probably reads like gibberish - guitars obviously do exist. So what's the deal?",

This seems like a true statement, but unicorns don't exist. Perhaps what we mean by 'All unicorns have one horn' is that <i>if</i> a unicorn existed, <i>then</i> it would have one horn. But if we interpret the statement about unicorns that way, shouldn't we also interpret the statement about dogs that way? Really all we mean when we say ``All dogs are mammals'' is that if there were dogs, then they would be mammals. It takes an extra assertion to point out that dogs do, in fact, exist.",

            "The issue we are discussing here is called existential import. A sentence is said to have existential import if it asserts the existence of the things it is talking about. Until Boole, universal-affirmative statements were often interpreted as having existential import. You might find that more intuitive, but if you interpret all universal-affirmative statements with existential import, they are always false when you are talking about things that don't exist. So, 'All unicorns have one horn' is false in the traditional interpretation. On the other hand, in the modern interpretation all statements about things that don't exist are true. 'All unicorns have one horn' simply asserts that there are no multi-horned unicorns, and this is true because there are no unicorns at all. We call this vacuous truth. Something is vacuously true if it is true simply because it is about things that don't exist. Note that all statements about nonexistent things become vacuously true if you assume they have no existential import, even a statement like ``All unicorns have more than one horn.'' A statement like this simply rules out the existence of unicorns with one horn or fewer, and these don't exist because unicorns don't exist. This is a complicated issue that will come up again starting in later sections when we consider conditional statements in this module, and predicate logic later.",

In addition to varying the kind of statements we use in an Aristotelian syllogism, we can also vary the placement of the terms involved. The combination of 64 moods and 4 figures gives us a total of 256 possible Aristotelian syllogisms. Most of these are valid, but a good chunk of them are.
