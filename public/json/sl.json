Notice that when we draw diagrams for the two universal forms, we do not draw any x's. For these forms we are only ruling out possibilities, not asserting that things actually exist. This is part of what Venn learned from Boole. The proposition, 'All guitars are plucked instruments,' denies the existence of any guitar that is not a plucked, but it does not assert the existence of some guitar that is a plucked. That probably reads like gibberish - guitars obviously do exist. So what's the deal?",

This seems like a true statement, but unicorns don't exist. Perhaps what we mean by 'All unicorns have one horn' is that <i>if</i> a unicorn existed, <i>then</i> it would have one horn. But if we interpret the statement about unicorns that way, shouldn't we also interpret the statement about dogs that way? Really all we mean when we say 'All dogs are mammals' is that if there were dogs, then they would be mammals. It takes an extra assertion to point out that dogs do, in fact, exist.",

            "The issue we are discussing here is called existential import. A sentence is said to have existential import if it asserts the existence of the things it is talking about. Until Boole, universal-affirmative statements were often interpreted as having existential import. You might find that more intuitive, but if you interpret all universal-affirmative statements with existential import, they are always false when you are talking about things that don't exist. So, 'All unicorns have one horn' is false in the traditional interpretation. On the other hand, in the modern interpretation all statements about things that don't exist are true. 'All unicorns have one horn' simply asserts that there are no multi-horned unicorns, and this is true because there are no unicorns at all. We call this vacuous truth. Something is vacuously true if it is true simply because it is about things that don't exist. Note that all statements about nonexistent things become vacuously true if you assume they have no existential import, even a statement like 'All unicorns have more than one horn.' A statement like this simply rules out the existence of unicorns with one horn or fewer, and these don't exist because unicorns don't exist. This is a complicated issue that will come up again starting in later sections when we consider conditional statements in this module, and predicate logic later.",

In addition to varying the kind of statements we use in an Aristotelian syllogism, we can also vary the placement of the terms involved. The combination of 64 moods and 4 figures gives us a total of 256 possible Aristotelian syllogisms. Most of these are valid, but a good chunk of them are.

In algebra, you had equations like $y = 2x + 3$, where $x$ and $y$ were variables that could stand for any number. Just as $x$ could stand for any number in algebra, `S' can stand for any name in logic. In fact, this is one of the original uses of variables.",

            "The importance of the variable for the history of mathematics is obvious. But it was also incredibly important in one of its original fields of application, logic. For one thing, it allows logicians to be more content neutral. We can set aside any associations we have with people, or carrots, or whatever, when we are analyzing an argument. More importantly, once we set aside content in this way, we discover that something incredibly powerful is left over, the logical structure of the sentence itself. This is what we investigate when we study formal logic. In the case of the two arguments above, identifying the logical structure of statements reveals not only that the two arguments have the same logical form, but they have an impeccable logical form. Both arguments are valid, and any other arguments that have this form will be valid. ",

They learned to replicate the whole structure of sentences with a formal system that brought out all sorts of features of the logical form of arguments. The result was the creation of entire artificial languages. An artificial_language is a language that was consciously developed by identifiable individuals for some purpose.",

            "Artificial languages contrast with natural language, which develop spontaneously and are learned by infants as their first language. Natural languages include all the well-known languages spoken around the world, like English or Japanese or Arabic. The languages developed by logicians are artificial, not natural. When the languages first started being developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the goal was, in fact, to have a logically pure language, free of the irrationalities the plague natural languages. More specifically, they had two distinct goals: first, remove all ambiguity and vagueness, and second, to make the logical structure of the language immediately apparent, so that the language wore its logical structure on its face, as it were. If such a language could be developed, it would help us solve all kinds of problems. The logician and philosopher Rudolf Carnap, for instance, felt that the right artificial language could simply make philosophical problems disappear. (The few quotes that randomly occur on the front page of this website encapsulate this sentiment.)",

            "For the purposes of this textbook, we will say that the core idea of a  formal_language is that it is an artificial language designed to bring out the logical structure of ideas and remove all the ambiguity and vagueness that plague natural languages like English. Creating formal languages always involves all kinds of trade offs. On the one hand, we are trying to create a language that makes a logical structure clear and obvious. This will require simplifying things, removing excess baggage from the language. On the other hand, we want to make the language perfectly precise, free of vagueness and ambiguity. This will mean adding complexity to the language. The other thing was that it was very important for the people developing these languages that you be able to prove the all the truths of mathematics in them. This meant that the languages had to have a certain scope.",

            "This was a trade off no logician was ever able to get perfectly correct, because, as it turns out, a logically pure language is impossible. No formal language can do everything that a natural language can do. Logicians became convinced of this, naturally enough, because of a pair of logical proofs. In 1931, the logician Kurt Goedel showed that you couldn't do all of mathematics in a consistent logical system, which was enough to persuade most of the logicians engaged in the project to drop it. There is a more general problem with the idea of a purely logical language, though, which is that that many of the features logicians were trying to remove from language were actually necessary to make it function. Arika Okrent puts the point quite well. For Okrent, the failure of artificial languages is precisely what illuminates the virtues of natural language. "

More precisely, a truth value is the status of a statement with relationship to truth. We have to say this, because there are systems of logic that allow for truth values besides 'true' and 'false,' like 'maybe true,' or 'approximately true,' or 'kinda sorta true.' For instance, some philosophers have claimed that the future is not yet determined. If they are right, then statements about what will be the case are not yet true or false. Some systems of logic accommodate this by having an additional truth value. Other formal languages, so-called paraconsistent logics, allow for statements that are both true {and} false.
