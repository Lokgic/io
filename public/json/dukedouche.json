Now, this usually peaceful island is full of college students looking for good times.", "There, Duke students are referred as dukes, and students from the other school are called douches.

Each student is either a duke, or a douche.","On the day of your arrival, you come across three students, whom we will call A, B, and C. You ask A: 'are you a duke or a douche?' Unfortunately, A has been partying too much and is slurring her words. You can't quite make out what she's saying, so you ask B: 'What did A say?' B replies: 'She said she's a douche.' At this point, C jumps in and says: 'Don't believe B; it's a lie!'"]
