      "chapterDescription":"The key to studying argument is to set aside the subject being argued about and to focus on the way it is argued for. If we say an argument is good, then the same kind of argument applied to a different topic will also be good.  If we say an argument is good for solving murders, we will also say that the same kind of argument is good for deciding where to eat, what kind of disease is destroying your crops, or who to vote for. Because logic sets aside what an argument is about, and just looks at how it works rationally, logic is said to have content neutrality. In formal logic we get content neutrality by replacing parts of the argument we are studying with abstract symbols. In this chapter, we begin our study of formal logic by learning about a symbolic language called $SL$",
